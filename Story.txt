One day in elementary school, Sachkeerat had his best friend Pyerce was talking about
something. In the conversation, Pyerce had to promise something so Sachkeerat would know
for sure he wasn't lying. Pyerce said "I swear." A teacher overhears the conversation
and comes over. She tells Pyerce to not swear and that swearing is bad.
